This plugin defines a widget for showing a slideshow of images, 100% Javascript (jQuery).

== Description ==

Do you want a widget for your sidebar featuring a **slideshow**? Do you want to show your images or ads **more eye-catching**? Here it is.

Simple but functional, **Smart Slideshow Widget** allows you to create as many slideshow widgets for your sidebar as you want, it only needs the image folder and the folder's URL, *that's it*.

Translation ready (i18n), now includes full translation to:

*	English (default).
*	Spanish.

If you have a new translation for your language, please email me and I'll add it to the package.

The settings allow you to customize every Slideshow Widget you add, including:

*	10 gorgeous effects for the slideshow.
*   Custom CSS style for your images.
*   Delay (in seconds) between images and animation speed.
*	Image order (regular, inverse or random).
*   Link for your images (optional).
*	Manual controls (previous/next buttons).
