	<h1 id="introduction">A) Introduction - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
		
	<p>
		The purpose of WordPress Access Control is to provide an easy interface to users for
		restricting access to content. It was designed for use on members sites where not all
		content should be accessible by the public, such as with organizations or pay-sites.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		WPAC gives you the ability to restrict content to members, specific roles, or even
		non-members on a per-page/per-post basis, or using shortcodes. You can still add
		restricted pages to the navigation, and by default they will only show up to users
		with the required access. This is an option however.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		WPAC also gives you the ability to customize search/archive pages, completing hiding
		restricted posts/pages from search results if a user can't access them, showing just
		the title with a customizable message where the excerpt would be, or showing the title
		and excerpt.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		WPAC now gives admins the ability to set the visibility of certain widgets to members only
		or non-members only, as well as create member only versions of all WordPress nav menus.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This plugin supports custom post types via an easy to use admin option.
	</p>

	<h1 id="requirements">B) Requirements - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>

	<p>
		WordPress Access Control has only been tested with WordPress 2.9 and greater. WordPress Access Control requires <strong>PHP4</strong> or higher, although <strong>PHP5</strong> is recommended. 
	</p>
	
	<p style="color:red;">
		WordPress Access Control may not work with all themes. If you find are using WPAC with a theme and it's not working well, please contact me with the name of the theme as well as a link to the theme, and your PHP version.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="installation">C) Installation &amp; Configuration - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		Installation is simple, just follow these steps and you should have no problems. 
	</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Upload the wordpress-access-control/ folder included in the zip to your WordPress installation's plugin folder. The default location should be /wp-content/plugins/</li>
		<li>Login to your WordPress administration panel, located by default at http://your-site-here.com/wp-admin/</li>
		<li>Click on Plugins on the left menu</li>
		<li>Scroll down to &ldquo;WordPress Access Control&rdquo; and click the "Activate" link</li>
		<li>Scroll back down to &ldquo;WordPress Access Control&rdquo; and click "Visit options page". Alternatively, you can access this from Settings &gt; Members Only</li>
		<li>Set your default settings. An explanation of the settings can be found below.</li>
		<li>Finished!</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h1 id="settings">D) Settings - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		Using the settings screen, you can set many default options for the 
		plugin, which is useful for saving time if most of your pages/posts 
		will have similar access settings. Most of these settings can be 
		overwritten on a per-page/per-post basis.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="general_options">A) General Options - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Make Blog Members Only</strong><br />
		This setting will make the blog page itself, as well as any archive 
		pages restricted to members. Regular pages will still be accessible 
		to non-members however. This setting uses the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_home">is_home()</a> and 
		<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_archive">is_archive()</a> functions to determine blog/archive pages.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Members Blog Redirect</strong><br />
		This setting is a website address to redirect users to if they try to
		access the blog or archive pages with the "Make Blog Members Only" 
		setting active. By default, it will redirect to the login page.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Custom Post Types</strong><br />
		This setting allows you to enable the Members Only controls for custom
		post types. This setting only works if the custom post type uses the
		standard WordPress interface. This option will not be displayed if there
		are no custom post types.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="override_permissions">B) Override Permisisons - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Always Accessible By</strong><br />
		
		This will override any per-page or per-post settings and allow the specified user
		groups to always have access to members only content. This was to fix a scenario
		in which a lesser user such as a Contributor could make content invisible to a
		higher user such as an administrator.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="menu_options">C) Menu Options - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Display In Menus</strong><br />
		This setting determines how menu items work when a restricted page/post is
		added to the navigation and a user doesn't have access to it. You can 
		show the menu only if a user has access to it, or you can show it all
		the time. If you decide to show it all the time, a user who clicks on a menu
		item but does not have access to view it will be redirected.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="postpage_default_options">D) Post/Page Default Options - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Default Post State</strong><br />
		This setting determines the default option when creating a new post. Public
		is the default setting and means the post will be accessible to all. Members
		Only restricts the post to authenticated users, and Non-Members restricts
		the post to unauthenticated users.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Posts: Only Accessible By</strong><br />
		This setting determines the default option when creating a new page for which
		roles can access the post. This setting is only used if the post is set for
		Members Only. Roles are managed using plugins.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Default Page State</strong><br />
		This setting determines the default option when creating a new page. Public
		is the default setting and means the page will be accessible to all. Members
		Only restricts the page to authenticated users, and Non-Members restricts
		the page to unauthenticated users.<br /><br />This setting also acts as 
		the default for custom post types.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Pages: Only Accessible By</strong><br />
		This setting determines the default option when creating a new page for which
		roles can access the page. This setting is only used if the page is set for
		Members Only. Roles are managed using plugins.<br /><br />This setting also acts as 
		the default for custom post types.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Default Redirect For Members Only Pages</strong><br />
		This is the default URL to redirect users to when they attempt to access
		a restricted page/post.<br /><br />
		
		The link provided here is automatically appended with a redirect_to query
		argument, so that the page may redirect the user back if they wish.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="search_options">E) Search/Archive Options - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Search Options</strong><br />
		This setting determines how restricted posts/pages will appear in 
		search or archive pages. This setting uses <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_search">is_search()</a>
		and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_archive">is_archive()</a> 
		to determine use.<br /><br />
		If you do not check "Show restricted post excerpts in search results?" the excerpt
		will be replaced with text from the below options.<br /><br />
		The page settings for this setting determine defaults for custom post types.<br /><br />
		
		<strong>Search Excerpt (Posts)/Search Excerpt (Pages)</strong><br />
		This text is displayed instead of the post/page excerpt in archive/search pages to users
		without the required access, but only if the post/page is set to now show it's 
		excerpt.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="shortcodes">E) Shortcodes - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		There are two shortcodes available for use with this plugin.<br /><br />
		
		[members][/members] will hide the content within them unless the user is
		authenticated. Also works during searching, so that if a user searches for
		a term found in the shortcodes, but is not logged in, the page/post will
		not show up in the results.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		[nonmembers][/nonmembers] will hide the content within them unless the user is
		not authenticated. Also works during searching, so that if a user searches for
		a term found in the shortcodes, but is logged in, the page/post will
		not show up in the results.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="interface">F) Posts/Pages Interface - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		By default, when you edit/add a new post/page, the control interface should be displayed on 
		the right, directly above the "Publish" box. If you do not see it, please ensure it is set to
		display under the "Screen Options" panel.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="assets/images/default_interface.png" alt="" /><br />
		The default interface is very small, and lacks many options. More options will appear once
		you've checked an option.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="assets/images/members_interface.png" alt="" /><br />
		If you select "Only accessible by members?", several new options appear. The default values
		are governed by the options screen, and an explanation of the options are available above 
		as well.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="assets/images/nonmembers_interface.png" alt="" /><br />
		If you select "Only accessible by non-members?", one new option appears. This is the URL
		to redirect a user to, such as the my profile page or even a logout page.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="widgets_interface">G) Widgets Interface - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		Now, when you add certain supported widgets to a widget area, you have the option to select
		the visibility of the widget as members only or non-members only. Currently, the only supported
		widget is the Custom Menu widget. If you would like more widgets added, please contact the developer.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="assets/images/widgets_interface.jpg" alt="" /><br />
		The additional options are limited. You can select "Only visible by members" and the widget will
		only be displayed to users who are logged in. If you select "Only visibile by non-members" the
		widget will only be displayed to users who are NOT logged in.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="menus_interface">H) Nav Menus Interface - <a href="#toc">top</a></h1>
	
	<p>
		Admins now have the ability of creating a second version of any menu that their theme supports,
		which will only be visible to logged in users. 
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="assets/images/menus_interface.jpg" alt="" /><br />
		The second menu in the list, "Primary Menu - Members Only" is automatically generated by this plugin. If
		you assign it a menu that is not empty, it will be displayed instead of it's regular version to any logged
		in user.
