Contributors: daltonrooney, rosswil
Tags: FAQs, custom posts 
Requires at least: 3.0.1
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 0.2.8

Create, categorize, and reorder FAQs and insert them into a page with a shortcode.

== Description ==

Create, categorize, and reorder FAQs and insert them into a page with a shortcode. Questions are shown/hidden with a simple jQuery animation; users without javascript enabled will click through to the single question page. Uses the native Custom Post Type functionality in WordPress 3.0. and above.

The plugin also includes functionality from the <a href="http://geekyweekly.com/mypageorder">My Page Order</a> plugin by Andrew Charlton.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from plugins page. 

The plugin registers a new custom post type, so you'll want to update your permalinks. No need to change your permalink structure, just go to "Settings->Permalinks" and click "Save Changes" without making any modifications.

Use the shortcode [qa] to insert your FAQs into a page.

If you want to sort your FAQs into categories, you can optionally use the cat attribute with the category slug. Example: [qa cat="cheese"] will return only FAQs in the "Cheese" category. You can find the category slug on the FAQ Categories page.

You can also insert a single FAQ with the format [aq id="1234"] where 1234 is the post ID.

* Note: the cat & the id attributes are mutually exclusive. Don't use both in the same shortcode.

Use the shortcode [search-qa] to insert a search form that will search only the FAQs.
		

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= With Javascript disabled, clicking on FAQ titles causes a 404 error.

Did you update your permalinks? (See installation).

= Can it do this, this, or that? =

Not yet. Maybe someday. You might want to drop a link in the [forum](http://madebyraygun.com/support/forum/).
