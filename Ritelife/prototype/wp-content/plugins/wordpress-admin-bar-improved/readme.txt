A set of custom tweaks to the WordPress Admin Bar that was introduced in WP 3.1. Since version 3.3.5 of this plugin, it is only compatible with WP 3.3 or greater, due to API changes.

== Description ==

This plugin has been completely re-written to interface with the WP 3.1 admin bar, and adds some much requested / great features to the WP Admin Bar. Due to API changes in WP 3.3, this plugin is no longer compatible with earlier versions of WordPress. It requires WP 3.3 or greater. If you are using a version prior to WP 3.3, please download and install [version 3.3.4](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wordpress-admin-bar-improved.3.3.4.zip) of this plugin, as the latest version will not work for you.
