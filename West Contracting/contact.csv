NB West Contact|B. Yaeger|re: Country Club Road Project||nospamaam5@yahoo.com||||||Mr. West:              -Called your company this afternoon and spoke to Debbie regarding the damages to our property. She was very courteous and patient and I appreciate her time.  However, it seems appropriate that we directly inform you of our concerns. In October, during the ongoing Country Club Road project in St. Charles,your employees accidentally graded the entire width of our property. That afternoon, Mr. Moore of St. Charles County Hwy. Dept., apologized and assured us that the soil would be replaced.(Per our January 13, 2005 settlement agreement with St. Charles County, our property was to remain at the 3:4 slope.)  We have already lost all of our shrubbery, a beautiful old tulip tree and countless other plants and had planned to do as much replanting as possible when the road project was completed. Our soil was beautiful and we could easily grow a variety of plants. We were willing to be patient about the soil replacement and felt that the situation would be rectified in the future as time allowed.  However, we were extremely disheartened to find that instead of replacing the soil, your company dumped layers of old ground asphalt and gravel along the sides and on top of our embankment, and that apparently, there are no plans to replace the soil. I have spoken with a representative from the DNR and an agronomist from the MU Ext. Center. Both stated that the land will now sustain little more than weeds. Ironically, some soil from our neighbors\' property was removed today during the sidewalk installation.  This beautiful soil is sitting in piles along the street to be used as fill elsewhere, while our embankment is now so hard and crusty with packed asphalt that I could barely even scratch the surface. Since we are off work during the holidays, we would like to bring this issue to a reasonable conclusion.  We have contacted the county several times and are simply asking for a resolution to this. We feel that this damage, left unabated, will destroy our privacy and devalue our property, and possibly affect our subdivision neighbors as well. We also contend that this is a violation of our 2005 agreement with the county as established in Circuit Court. We appreciate your time and attention in this matter.  Respectfully, Scott and Bets Yaeger      636-443-0674|Submit

NB West Contact|Jozsef Somfai|vortexjunction|0036703642143|vortex@t-online.hu|Pozsonyi utca 25.||Budapest, Hungary||1039|Do you know what all governments; cities and local authorities will need in the next decades? Do you know how big business would be if only you could do it for them in the whole World? Now we offer 20%-50% business share of the company which is based on our patent, facilitating the prevention of traffic congestion in junctions. This patented innovation will be able to differentiate you from the ordinariness in the next 17 years. Due to the rapid increase of the number of vehicles, traffic congestion occurring on public roads – mostly at the junctions – represents an increasingly serious problem. Vehicles standing in congestion not only pollute the environment, but also increase the risk of accidents by the stress on drivers and the haste after getting out of the traffic jams. Our new traffic distribution system, called Vortexjunction can ensure a balanced speed and a non-stop traffic flow in an intersection even with more than half a million vehicles per one day like a spaghetti-type bridge system does, but with a lower construction cost and with much more advantages. The original concept of the VORTEX roundabout is that the special „vortex-like” lay-out of the lanes enables the vehicles to pass through the traffic distribution structure, maneuvering between the lanes in one direction from the outside towards the inside, which significantly reduces the risk of accidents and facilitates and accelerates a non-stop traveling. Vortexjunction is the optimal solution in suburban area in the crossing of more than two roads carrying heavy traffic. The configuration of the intersection is flexible, it can be fit for the actual conditions and be able to operate the traffic effectively and safely according to the changing conditions. In the World numerous existing but aging big multi-level bridge systems must be changed soon to this cheaper and more effective Vortexjunction, instead of the expensive reconstruction to the same style. And due to the Vortexjunction’s simple structure, the quick reconstruction of a busy junction would last for a shorter period. Many more intersections should also be changed soon to this brand new Vortexjunction, where a spaghetti-type bridge system would had been the only one existing solution for heavy traffic problems, but that was too expensive. And as cities and traffic keep growing in the whole World, hundreds of new intersections will be built also in our Vortexjunction style in the renewed districts worldwide. We strongly believe that Vortexjunction will lead to very significant savings from several macroeconomic points of view. Furthermore it’s understood thing that all governments are going to compensate the general economy crisis with more road making projects in the next years. And in addition our invention is really a common interest, because for billions of people Vortexjunction is going to mean a better traveling with time- and energy-saving every day, there would be less fuel usage, less air pollution and less transportation time for millions of cars monthly, and – as road safety aspect is also extremely important, – fewer accidents as well. It is also important that Vortexjunction with its simple circular shape and few one-level-passovers would be a very nice and preferred improvement in citizen’s environment. For many governments and a lot more local authorities of towns Vortexjunction is going to mean millions of dollars from cost-savings in construction, because the construction costs of Vortexjunction are lower than those of other solutions that would be equivalent from the aspect of and traffic control and have similar maximum traffic permeability. In addition they can get enormous money from the benefits of the gained territories in an inhabited area, because a wide open space in the middle-field of Vortexjunction would be available for any kind of business establishment to build in, so this saleable land property can reduce a lot from the total construction cost! Briefly this new VORTEX system is a brand new opportunity for all traffic engineers and city-planners to make more economic and society benefit! If you were an investor or a local road constructors, we offer NOW to be the one and only principal contractor or building contractor with us, who can build this Vortexjunction and get the leading role in the building industry locally or just participating of selling its licenses anywhere in the World in the next two decades. We intend to establish an incorporated company with a tenderable investor anywhere in the World. We put out our prior rights for claiming national patents as a non-cash capital contribution that worth 3 million USD. In the beginning we expect minimum that our partner should fund 600,000 USD capitals into this business for a 20% BUSINESS SHARE of this company. We intend to sell maximum 50% business share for 1,500,000 USD for providing the operating cost until the big success within 5 years. The structure is ready for construction in new building projects. So now we all together should manage this project according to our preliminary business plan or leading by your professional knowledge, demonstrate the idea on conferences, promote it to the industry and lobby for business opportunities worldwide, meanwhile more and more studies will convince everybody it is time for changing. Vortexjunction will come into general use everywhere in the World soon and it will mean more and more profits for us year by year and it will carry all before one! You can visit our website to get more information: www.vortexjunction.com Further details and your offer should be discussed! Sincerely, Jozsef Somfai, vortex@t-online.hu 0036-70-3642143|Submit

NB West Contact|Thomas|Ameren UE Labadie Plant|314-992-8246|tsee@ameren.com|226 Labadie Power Plant Road||Labadie|MO|63055|As a Safety Prfessional- I was concerned when i saw one of your trucks flagging ahead of one of your paving machines on Wildhorse creek road this morning at about 6:40 AM.  There were two workers riding on top of the tool box in back of the cab and only one person actually in the cab.  This practice is dangerous and usually considered illegal.  If tthe truck had to stop suddenly, collided with another vehicle or went off the road the injuries could be very severe.  Just thought someone at your company should knwo this was going on.  It is good that they were warning oncoming traffic of the wide load but the limited sight distance on that road makes these riders even more dangerous than on a more open roadway.|Submit

NB West Contact|Andrew Wroblewski||315-926-5034|admin@yourprofitweb.com||New York|New York||10018|West Contracting    Recently I was looking in the search engines for the term Asphalt Paving Contractor Kansas City and found your website nbwest.com ranked at 37 (which is all the way back on page 4).    We both know that hardly anyone looks past page two any more, so with your rank for this keyword, no one is finding you.     But all is not lost, (not even in this economy).    You site is one of the better ones in your market and there is no reason why you couldn\'t rank higher for your keyword terms.    The only thing you are lacking is something called \"backlinks\".    Obtaining backlinks is what can propel you up the search engine rankings faster than most any other tactic and getting those backlinks is exactly what we specialize in and those backlinks are critical to your search engine ranking success.    We\'re able to do this because we possess resources that are unmatched in our industry and these valuable resources (combined with our experience and knowledge) are your key to superior rankings.    We quietly and quite successfully have (over time) worked with a long list of private clients....ALL of who LOVE us for the mere fact that we DELIVER on what we say we will do and that is simply: increasing your search engine rankings.    We want to earn your trust.      We want to earn your respect.    We want to earn your business.        We are so good at what we do, we are willing to prove it to you.    We are so confident we can help you, we are willing to prove it to you.    Here\'s what we would like to do: offer you irrefutable proof that we can deliver better rankings for YOUR site using YOUR keywords that are important to YOUR business......all risk-f.r.e.e.    We have your contact info as: (314) 962-3145. Is it ok if we give you a call?    It\'s been said that a page one ranking in the search engines is just like buying money at a discount.  Think about it:  the ability to purchase two dollars for a dollar. If you could do that.....how many would you buy?    Is it ok if I give you a call?      Sincerely,    Andrew Wroblewski  315-926-5034      P.S.  We only work EXCLUSIVELY with one client per market...is it going to be you?    P.S.S.  I also wanted you to know that we do not participate in \"recessions\" and (most importantly) neither do our clients :)    P.S.S.S.  I realize and know that you get A LOT of emails like this and I can almost hear you say \"arrrggghhh, another clown who claims he knows something about the search engines and website rankings\", but I assure that we are very different than almost any company you have ever spoken to in the past about search rank and I can prove it in one short, quick phone call.

Recent information have surfaced in which set this classic fashion residence inside a pretty severe as well as unflattering light.      Louis Vuitton Malletier, normally known as simply LV, is in fact among the most well-known fashion homes inside the business, possessing opened their gates way back 1854. So, offered the particular company\'s relatively long history, this shojuld not be a big surprise in which it provides a couple of pumpkin heads or scarecrows in their closet. Even so, the accusations aren\'t also pleasant.      A Shady Past      As a number of a person out there may well know, French fashion, specifically as it provides a lot history behind it, isn\'t any unfamiliar person to be able to controversy.      Case in point, renowned French custom Coco Chanel has been recognized having a acquired an information with a Nazi police officer as well as has been being charged with war crimes; thankfully regarding her, the lady has been saved through the treatment of the British Royal family, with who Coco had been on great terms.      The home associated with Vuitton has a somewhat similar story. In a magazine printed inside 2004, entitled Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, the writer found earlier unidentified information in regards to the fashion house\'s ties using the French Vichy regime, any government that can take on the dubious recognize to be liable for the transport associated with French Jews towards the concentration camps, where complete families died.      According to Stephanie Bonvicini, the actual book\'s author, people with the Vuitton household sympathized with as well as make an effort to supported the actual Vichy government, under the guideline regarding Marshal Philippe Petain. Their transactions using the Germans introduced them profitable returns.      A part note: Vichy France or the Vichy routine tend to be terms accustomed to signify the period coming from July 1940 to August 1944 when the existing government of the time, led by Petain, willfully collaborated with the Germans as well as their own occupation regarding France, sending several not guilty people with their deaths. The French milice or even militia noisy . and also put together Jews and other undesirables and had these sent to the camps.   The publication was initially proven like a venture in order to honor Vuitton\'s 150th anniversary; however, this wound up because one thing much more revealing.      The creator records that after the lady requested about the battle years, the organization answered that people data files acquired inexplicably burned. Bonvicini, pursued the problem and also had been generated find that Louis Vuitton had a retailer on the floor flooring from the Hotel du Parc during this time, which was especially odd, given the fact that all other shops were closed down. Moreover, Vuitton\'s grandson, who headed the company throughout the war, acquired told their son Henry to get friendly with the Petain regime. Henry has been eventually given honors regarding their devotion for the regime. As in the event that weren\'t bad enough, the organization actually setup the factory that is single determination was to create artifacts venerating Petain and his government.      <a href=http://www.ebaylouisvuittonsale.com>loui vuitton</a> is held by the LVMH Group (Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessy); the actual group doesn\'t not allow the facts, yet aren\'t interested in house on the past.
